Python Network Scanner
Overview
This tool is a functional Python script designed to identify open ports on a target IP address. I built this to demonstrate my understanding of TCP/IP protocols and my ability to automate vulnerability scanning tasks—core components of my CompTIA CySA+ certification and WGU Cybersecurity studies.

Features
Scans common ports including SSH (22), HTTP (80), and RDP (3389).

Utilizes the Python socket library for efficient network communication.

Provides clear status updates (OPEN/CLOSED) for identified ports.

How to Use
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

Clone this repository.

Run the script using python scanner.py.
